# People Counting with Radar and ML (Hackathon)

## Getting Started

**TL;DR:** This quick guide explains how to acquire data from the Infineon radar board with Python.

Please start by installing [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). We also recommend to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) for running the examples.

:warning: The recommended version of Python is 3.7, but it also works with Python 3.9. Problems occur currently with Python 3.10.

Afterwards you can clone this git repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Infineon/hackathon
cd hackathon
```

Now you can install the required Python package for the data acquisition with Pip:
```
pip install ifxdaq-3.0.1-py3-none-xxx.whl
```

:information_source: Make sure to replace _xxx_ by the correct filename according to your operating system and system architecture (see *.whl files in the repo for possible options).

**Now your system is ready to acquire radar data!**

Since some processing steps are recommended for the radar data you should install the following dependencies:

```
pip install numpy
pip install lsq-ellipse circle_fit
```

**For further information please check the ifxdaq documentation.** To access to documentation navigate in the cloned repository to the folder `docs` and open the file `index.html` with a web browser.

## FAQs

### What is a Range Map?
The range map is the spectrum when using a single transmit frequency. The `x` value shows the distance between the radar sensor and the target. The `y` value shows the magnitude of the reflected signal.

### What is a Range Doppler Map?
The range map is the spectrum when using varying transmit frequencies. The `x` value shows the distance between the radar sensor and the target. The `y` value shows the velocity of the target.

### What is a Chirp?
A Chirp is a transmitted signal with varying frequency.

### What is the Range Index?
The range index is a unitless number indicating at which distance the target is available. The physical distance can be calculated as `range_index * range_resolution`.

### What is the Range Resolution?
The Range Resolution can be calculated from the radar settings. As for our problem statement the radar settings are static the Range Resolution can be assumed as 7.5cm.

### What does Sample mean?
In the context of raw radar data, a Sample is the basic smallest building block that is transmitted. The Frames constitute of one or more Chirps, the Chirps are made of Samples. These Samples are coming directly from the ADC.
