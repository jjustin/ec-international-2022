Tutorials
=========

In the tutorials we are addressing different user groups. The first tutorial aims at users who just want to record and
label data without having to do any programming themselves. This is sufficient for many use-cases. However, if you want
to use the sensors in a live application, you need to do some programming yourself. Here the second tutorial covers the
most essential parts about discovering, configuring and capturing sensors.
The last tutorials cover more advanced topics around sensors and dealing with recorded data. Please have a look at those
chapters if you consider to implement your own sensors or want to process already recorded data on your own:
