Installation
============

.. tip::

    It's good practice to use a virtual environment. As libraries get updated, results from running your code can
    change, or your code can break completely. It's important to be able to reconstruct the set of packages and versions
    you're using. Best practice is to:

    1. use a different environment per project you're working on,
    2. record package names and versions using your package installer

    Feel free to install the package into your desired virtual environment (see `virtual environments
    <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_ and `this guide
    <https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko#howto>`_ for details on using virtual
    environments).


Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ifxdaq`` requires Python 3.7-3.9. **Python3.9** is the main development version - use this version if possible.

**Upgrade & install pip, setuptools & wheels**

Upgrade those tools to be able to install external dependencies also from source archives (in case there are no
pre-built wheels available):

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel


Installing ifxdaq
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the commands below to install the package. If you want to use the labeling algorithms for offline post-processing,
please install the package with the ``[ai]`` extension as shown below.


.. tabs::

    .. tab:: from a ``*.whl`` file

        .. tabs::

            .. code-tab:: bash Core package

                pip install ifxdaq-<version+platform>.whl

            .. code-tab:: bash Core package + Labeling extension

                pip install "ifxdaq-<version+platform>.whl[ai]"

    .. tab:: from Infineon Artifactory

        .. warning::
            The Infineon Artifactory is only accessible from within the Infineon company network.

        .. tabs::

            .. code-tab:: bash Core package

                pip install ifxdaq --extra-index-url https://artifactory.intra.infineon.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-pmm-center-virtual/simple

            .. code-tab:: bash Core package + Labeling extension

                pip install "ifxdaq[ai]" --extra-index-url https://artifactory.intra.infineon.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-pmm-center-virtual/simple


        .. note::
            You can also add the Infineon Artifactory URL permanently to your pip configuration file & omit the
            ``--extra-index-url`` flag.

            **Configuration file locations**:

            .. tabs::

                .. tab:: Windows

                    ``C:\Users\<USER>\pip\pip.ini``

                .. tab:: Unix

                    ``/home/<USER>/.pip/pip.conf``

            **Configuration file content**:

            .. code-block::

                [global]
                index-url = https://artifactory.intra.infineon.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-pmm-center-virtual/simple
