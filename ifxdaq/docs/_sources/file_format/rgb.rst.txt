RGB data (``rgb.mp4``)
==========================

**Format**

RGB data is stored in ``rgb.mp4`` videos. Each captured frame has an own timestamp that is stored in the respective
timestamps file. You can use an arbitrary media player to view the video files.

- file type: ``.mp4`` (`mp4@Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14>`_)

If you want to get access to the raw image frames, you have to decompress first the ``mp4`` files. The output shape
and data type depend on the library used to decompress the video. Our implementation supports:

- data type: ``uint8``
- data shape: 4D tensor - ``(frames, height, width, channels)`` - Channels is 1 (grayscale) or 3 (RGB).
