Tracking stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Track detected persons & objects over time with unique IDs. The tracking can be applied on detections generated with the
:ref:`ai/stages/detection:detection stage`.

.. important::
  If you operate outside the Infineon intranet, the weights for the ``ReID`` network must be downloaded manually. find
  more details in :ref:`ai/stages/detection:detection stage`.

.. note::
    The tracking algorithm adds an ``id`` and a ``track_state`` (:mod:`ifxdaq.ai.utils.TrackState`)

    to each detected object. Currently the following states exist:
    - Tentative: Not enough evidence is collected yet to confirm the track.
    - Confirmed: Enough evidence is collected to confirm the track.
    - Inactive: Tracked object is lost for a short time.
    - Deleted: Tracked object was lost for too long.
    - Interpolated: No detection, but the object was interpolated (e.g. fill small gaps).
